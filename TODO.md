# TODO list

- [x] Create start and end room with the teleporters
    - [] Figure out a way to get back from the dungeon
- [x] Figure out a way to list and link all the teleporters together
    - [x] Fix the crash
    - [x] Make the teleporter block detection scan the chunk at least (i think finding any block will deem the chunk obscured)
- [x] Re-implement the dungeon builder to work in a block-wise manner
- [] Make the dungeon generator procedural (PortalBE flag IS_DEBUG will make the dungeon generate the debugging layout)
- [] Need complete models for the rooms because now the floors work meaning i need the staircase build
- [] Disable block destruction for the dimension
