# TODO list

- [] Create start and end room with the teleporters
- [x] Figure out a way to list and link all the teleporters together
    - [x] Fix the crash
    - [x] Make the teleporter block detection scan the chunk at least (i think finding any block will deem the chunk obscured)
- [x] Re-implement the dungeon builder to work in a block-wise manner
- [] Make the dungeon generator procedural (PortalBE flag IS_DEBUG will make the dungeon generate the debugging layout)
